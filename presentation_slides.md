## Slide 2: Problem Statement
**Challenges in Manual Scheduling**

*   **Time-Consuming:** Manual creation of timetables takes weeks of effort.
*   **Human Errors:** High probability of overlaps and double-booking.
*   **Resource Inefficiency:** Classrooms and labs are often underutilized or overbooked.
*   **Constraint Complexity:** Difficult to manually balance faculty workload (e.g., 18 hours/week) and lab blocking.

---

## Slide 3: Proposed Solution
**Automated & Optimized Scheduling**

*   **Intelligent Automation:** An algorithmic approach to generate conflict-free timetables instantly.
*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** Automatically adheres to strict rules (faculty load, lab continuity).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Easy to modify and regenerate schedules when constraints change.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple input for data and clear visualization of the final schedule.

---

## Slide 4: System Architecture / Workflow
**How It Works**

1.  **Input Data:** Admin inputs Faculty, Subjects, Rooms, and Constraints.
2.  **Processing Engine:** The core algorithm processes data against defined rules.
3.  **Conflict Detection:** System checks for overlaps (Room, Faculty, Student Group).
4.  **Optimization:** Iteratively improves the schedule to meet soft constraints.
5.  **Output Generation:** Final timetable is displayed and exported (PDF/Excel).
